"""Build per-location spatial features from the real ADM5 boundary geojson.

Outputs sector_spatial.csv with, per location id:
  centroid_lon, centroid_lat   -- polygon centroid (shoelace), static geography
  n_neighbours                 -- degree in the edge-adjacency graph
and writes sector_neighbours.json: {location_id: [neighbour ids...]}.

Adjacency: two polygons are neighbours if their boundaries share an edge,
detected as >=2 shared (rounded) vertices. No shapely dependency.
